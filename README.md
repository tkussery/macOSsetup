# macOSsetup
A compilation of everything I do to setup a new Mac, including dotfiles, Mac defaults, and more. As I do enjoy fresh installs, this helps me get back up quicker. Made public for others to benefit from if they find it useful.

You'll find various themes including: development, photography, videography, personal, and others. I have numerous uses for my machine.

## Originals
Within the "orig" directory are the original files from whomever I grabbed them from, untouched. Everything else was customized or added based on those.

## Credits
Most of what's found here is forked from other work and customized to my tastes. I tried to capture the authors here. Please contact me if I missed someone. It wasn't intentional, promise!
